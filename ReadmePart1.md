# Claude Code MCP-Offloading Hack
## Reduce Token Usage by ~90% Using External Python Execution
Based on the “Code Execution with MCP” workflow demonstrated by Anthropic and the optimization shared by @omarsar0.

## Overview
This project implements a powerful optimization for Claude Code (LLM) that reduces token usage by up to 90% by removing preloaded MCP tools from context and performing tool execution inside a lightweight Python runtime...
